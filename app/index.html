 		<h2 class="about-content__title title">About Plae</h2>
 		<p>Previously a Designer for Puma and Adidas, Head Designer Ryan Ringholz has started a new revolution in kids trainers. Using technology usually reserved for elite athletes, Plae creates shoes designed especially for a childâ€™s foot.
 		</p>
 		<p>Because kids feet are always growing, their shoes should accommodate leaving the cartilage and fledgling bone room to grow its own way. The interchangeable tabs adjust to accommodate thinner, wider or thicker feet and nearly all Plae shoes can fit an AFO orthotic brace.</p>
 		<p>With their dynamic traction, little feet can feel the ground beneath them and get a grip on it. The rest is designed to elite athlete standards: super shock absorption, durable toe guards, and wicking, washable anti-microbial inserts.</p>
 		<p>With every shoe, Plae sources responsible, recycled, and non-toxic materials, and makes sure manufacturing and labour is fair and child-free.</p>
